# HackerRank 30 Days of Code C# :computer:

- [x] Completed all 30 days

This is my repository dedicated to my solutions to HackerRank's 30 Days of Code coding problems, written in C#.
My goal is to learn C# by completing these coding problems provided by HackerRank.  Each day will have an associated folder,
with a README specifying what the coding problem was for that day.

This code was written in the C# language in Microsoft's Visual Studio 2019 IDE.  The solutions I give will be unit tested
by tests that are provided by HackerRank.

***NOTE:** The first day is Day 0, and the last day is Day 29 (making it 30 total days).*

***NOTE:** Day 27 did not offer C# as a coding option on HackerRank's website.  As such, for that day I decided to program that coding challenge in C++.*

### Concluding Thoughts 

I feel like HackerRank's 30 Days of Code challenge did teach me how to program in C# fairly well!  I was happy that we had covered a fair
amount of data structures -- more than I was initially expecting.  I was also happy that a wide variety of concepts had been discussed throughout these 30 days (examples discussed below).

My biggest issue is that the coverage of sorting algorithms was very weak (I believe it was just one day, and the implementation was essentially provided for you).  I also was very disappointed that Day 27 did not have compatibility with the C# language (To clarify, HackerRank's website did not have C# as an option to program Day 27 in).  One last minor complaint is that the first several days started off very basic; though I do acknowledge that it made the transition into learning C# slower and easier, as well as making it more friendly for people that are newer to programming to participate in as well.

Ultimately, I feel like the concepts discussed in these challenges were generally good to learn.  We had discussed concepts such as generics, interfaces, abstract classes, linked lists, stack, queues, binary trees, exceptions, etc., which are pretty relevant and important concepts to understand as a software developer.  As a result, I do feel much more confident in my ability to code in C#, and I do believe that participating in HackerRank's 30 Days of Code was worth doing.

One main thing I would change about my implementations is that I had used the method capitalization conventions found in Java (camelCasing), but I had realized very late that in C#, according to [.NET Capitalization Conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/capitalization-conventions?redirectedfrom=MSDN), that the convention for method capitalization in C# uses PascalCasing.  This means that any methods I had created (especially before the last few days) used camelCasing rather than PascalCasing.  I will keep this mistake in mind for whenever I code in C#/.NET languages in the future.
