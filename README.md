# HackerRank 30 Days of Code C#

This is my repository dedicated to my solutions to HackerRank's 30 Days of Code coding problems, written in C#.
My goal is to learn C# by completing these coding problems provided by HackerRank.  Each day will have an associated folder,
with a README specifying what the coding problem was for that day.

This code was written in the C# language in Microsoft's Visual Studio 2019 IDE.  The solutions I give will be unit tested
by tests that are provided by HackerRank.

***NOTE:** Day 27 did not offer C# as a coding option on HackerRank's website.  As such, for that day I decided to program that coding challenge in C++.*
