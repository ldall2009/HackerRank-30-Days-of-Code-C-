# HackerRank Day 29

### Objective

Welcome to the last day! Today, we're discussing bitwise operations.

### Task

Given set `S = {1, 2, 3, ..., N}`, find two integers, A and B (Where A < B), from 
set S such that the values of `A & B` is the maximum possible and also less than 
a given integer, K.  In this case, & represents the bitwise AND operator.

### Input Format

The first line contains an integer, T, the number of test cases.
Each of the T subsequent lines defines a test case as 2 space-separated integers, 
N and K, respectively.

### Constraints

- 1 <= T <= 10^3
- 2 <= N <= 10^3
- 2 <= K <= N

### Output Format

For each test case, print the maximum possible value of `A & B` on a new line.
