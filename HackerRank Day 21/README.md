### Objective

Today we're discussing Generics.

### Task

Write a single generic function named printArray; this function must take 
an array of generic elements as a parameter (the exception to this is C++, 
which takes a vector).

### Input Format

The locked Solution class in your editor will pass different types of 
arrays to your printArray function.

### Constraints

- You must have exactly 1 function named PrintArray.

### Output Format

Your PrintArray function should print each element of its generic array 
parameter on a new line.
