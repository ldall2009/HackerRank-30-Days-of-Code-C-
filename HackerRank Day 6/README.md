# HackerRank Day 6

### Objective

Today we're expanding our knowledge of Strings and combining it with what
we've already learned about loops.

### Task

Given a string, S, of length N that is indexed from 
0 to N - 1, print its even-indexed and odd-indexed characters 
as 2 space-separated strings on a single line 
(see the Sample below for more detail).

##### Note: 0 is considered to be an even index.

### Input Format

The first line contains an integer, T (the number of test cases).
Each line i of the T subsequent lines contain a String, S.

### Constraints

- 1 <= T <= 10
- 2 <= length of S <= 10000

### Output Format

for each String S_j (where 0 <= j <= T-1), print S_j's even-indexed characters,
 followed by S_j's odd-indexed characters.
