# HackerRank Day 5

### Objective

In this challenge, we're going to use loops to help us do some simple math.

### Task

Given an integer, n, print its first 10 multiples. 
Each multiple n * i (where 1 <= i <= 10) should be printed on a new 
line in the form: `n x i = result`.

### Input Format

A single integer, n.

### Constraints

2 <= n <= 20

### Output Format

Print 10 lines of output; each line i (where 1 <= 1 <= 10) contains 
the result of n * i in the form: `n x i = result`.
