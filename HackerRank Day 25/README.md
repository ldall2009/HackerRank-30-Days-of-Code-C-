# HackerRank Day 25

### Objective

Today we're learning about running time!

### Task

A prime is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other 
than 1 and itself. Given a number, n, determine and print whether it's Prime 
or Not prime.

Note: If possible, try to come up with a O(sqrt(n)) primality algorithm.

### Input Format

The first line contains an integer, T, the number of test cases.
Each of the T subsequent lines contains an integer, n, to be tested for primality.

### Constraints

- 1 <= T <= 30
- 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^9

### Output Format

For each test case, print whether n is `Prime` or `Not prime` on a new line.
