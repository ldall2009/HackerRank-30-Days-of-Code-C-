# HackerRank Day 7

### Objective

Today, we're learning about the Array data structure.

### Task

Given an array, A, of N integers, print A's elements in reverse order as 
a single line of space-separated numbers.

### Input Format

The first line contains an integer, N (the size of our array).
The second line contains N space-separated integers describing array A's 
elements.

### Constraints

- 1 <= N <= 1000
- 1 <= A_i <= 10000, where A_i is the ith integer in the array.

### Output Format

Print the elements of array A in reverse order as a single line of space-
separated numbers.
