# HackerRank Day 0

##### Objective

In this challenge, we review some basic concepts that will get you started with this series. 
You will need to use the same (or similar) syntax to read input and write output in challenges throughout HackerRank. 

##### Task

To complete this challenge, you must save a line of input from stdin to a variable and print the value of your
variable 

**NOTE:** I have modified the task slightly to remove the `Hello, World.` text that was initially asked for in
HackerRank.  Additionally, I printed additional text that I believe make the program more user friendly: I printed text
that asked the user to enter a string input, and I later printed `"The string you have entered is: "` followed by the string the
user entered.
