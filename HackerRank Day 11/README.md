# HackerRank Day 11

### Objective

Today, we're building on our knowledge of Arrays by adding another dimension.

### Context

Given a 6x6 2D array, A:

[image]

We define an hourglass in A to be a subset of values with indices falling
in this pattern in A's graphical representation:

[image]

There are 16 hourglasses in A, and an hourglass sum is the sum of an
hourglass' values

### Task

Calculate the hourglass sum for every hourglass in A, then print the
maximum hourglass sum.

### Input Format

There are 6 lines of input, where each line contains 6 space-separated
integers describing 2D Array A; every value in A will be in the inclusive
range of -9 to 9.

### Constraints

- -9 <= A[i][j] <= 9
- 0 <= i,j <= 5

### Output Format

Print the largest(maximum) hourglass sum found in A.
