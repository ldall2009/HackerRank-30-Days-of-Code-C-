### Objective

Today, we're getting started with Exceptions by learning how to parse an 
integer from a string and print a custom error message.

### Task

Read a string, S, and print its integer value; if S cannot be converted to 
an integer, print `Bad String`.

Note: You must use the String-to-Integer and exception handling 
constructs built into your submission language.

### Input Format

A single string, S.

### Output Format

Print the parsed integer value of S, or `Bad String` if S cannot be converted
 to an integer.
